# pokeemerald-expansion with OW Expansion and Dynamic Overworld Palette System

I have personally reworked the outdated OW Expansion and Dynamic Overworld Palette System features to be fully compatible with the most recent version of pokeemerald-expansion (as of July 4, 2024).  

I may have tweaked them for compatibility, but they are still to be credited to their original creators.  
Thank you to ghoulslash for creating the OW Expansion!  
Thank you to Slawter666, Xhyzi, ShantyTown, ExpoSeed, UltimaSoul, and ShinyDragonHunter for the Dynamic Overworld Palette System!
